## Overview
I created a beginner portfolio using the Bootstrap grid system. The portfolio consists of three pages: 1.) About, 2.) Portfolio, and 3.) Contact. Each page uses semantic html brought over from the Bootstrap webpage, contains responsive elements, and is optimized for multiple viewports from mobile all the way up to large desktop screens. Each page has a navbar linking to each page and a sticky footer at the bottom. Each external link opens in a new tab

## About/index.html
This page consists of one row of elements and two columns with a single breakpoint at the "xs" size predefined in Bootstrap. The left column features a single image that is responsive to every size screen and completely fills up the screen at the "xs" size. The right column is a small about me portion with one sub-row and two-subcolumns within that sub-row listing skills. No links were added to this page.

## Contact
Three large buttons were placed linking to my email, Instagram, and Facebook accounts on one row. At the breakpoint, the buttons become vertical suited for mobile devices.

## Portfolio
Due to a lack of coding portfolio, six buttons linking to various websites fixed at a width of 300px were placed in one row with two seperate breakpoints. The largest screen size will show the buttons in a 2l x 3w grid, the next breakpoint will show them in a 3l x 2w grid, and finally the last breakpoint organizes them into a single column down the page.

Below this text is the original README for the assigment for comparison.

   # Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

   Responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. As a developer, you will likely be asked to create a mobile-first application or add responsive design to an existing application. 


   ## Directions

   First, you will use the Bootstrap CSS Framework to create a mobile responsive portfolio. How do you deliver this? Here are some guidelines:

   * Create the following files files: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.

   * Using Bootstrap, develop your portfolio site with the following items:

      * A navbar

      * A responsive layout

      * Responsive images

   * The Bootstrap portfolio should minimize the use of media queries.

   * Screenshots are provided as a reference in the `Assets/Images` folder. Your app does not need to be _exactly_ like the images. Use Bootstrap to create a similar, responsive layout.

   ### Hints

   * Use Bootstrap's grid system (containers, rows, and columns).

   * On an `xs` screen, content should take up the entire screen. On `sm` and larger screens, you should have some margins on the left and right sides of the screen. Check out various sites on your mobile device vs. your computer to see examples of these differences.

   * Use an HTML validation service to ensure that each page has valid HTML.

   ### Minimum Requirements

   * Functional, deployed application

   * GitHub repository with README describing the project

   * Navbar must be consistent on each page.

   * Navbar on each page must contain links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages.

   * All links must work.

   * Must use semantic html.

   * Each page must have valid and correct HTML. (use a validation service)

   * Must contain your personalized information. (bio, name, images, links to social media, etc.)

   * Must properly utilize Bootstrap components and grid system.


   ### Bonus

   * Using Bootstrap, make a sticky footer and use sub-rows and sub-columns on your portfolio site (**Hint:** Check out the Bootstrap documentation).


   ## Commit Early and Often

   One of the most important skills to master as a web developer is version control. Building the habit of committing via Git is important for two reasons:

   * Your commit history is a signal to employers that you are actively working on projects and learning new skills.

   * Your commit history allows you to revert your codebase in the event that you need to return to a previous state.

   Follow these guidelines for committing:

   * Make single-purpose commits for related changes to ensure a clean, manageable history. If you are fixing two issues, make two commits.

   * Write descriptive, meaningful commit messages so that you and anyone else looking at your repository can easily understand its history.

   * Don't commit half-done work, for the sake of your collaborators (and your future self!).

   * Test your application before you commit to ensure functionality at every step in the development process.

   We would like you to have well over 200 commits by graduation, so commit early and often!


   ## Submission on BCS
